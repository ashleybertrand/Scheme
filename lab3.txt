Lab 3 Questions

1. (3 8 9 2 4 10)
2. Function f adds 1 to each element in the provided list and returns the new list.
3. A check to see if list is null
4. If list is null, continue as if it were an empty list
5. Build a list of the current list, adding 1 to the first element, combined with 
the list recursively called on f without the first element
6. #f
7. #t
8. #f
9. #f
10. (sandwich ham blue eggs and cheese)
11. (blue cheese and)
12. Scheme is a great language for mathematical function evaluation and list 
manipulation.  There are many built-in functions that would make it quick and easy 
to implement member?, set?, union, and intersect, had we been allowed to use them.
13. The syntax looks much different from the object-oriented programming that I am 
used to, which made it difficult to learn and work with.
14. 5 hours
15. I enjoyed this lab because it was interesting learning a different class of 
programming languages.  I probably will not use Scheme again unless it is required 
because I am much more comfortable with object-oriented programming which can also be 
used to solve these same problems using a syntax that is much more readable.
